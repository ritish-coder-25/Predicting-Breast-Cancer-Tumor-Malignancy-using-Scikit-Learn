# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Tumor-Malignancy-using-Scikit-Learn
This program uses Scikit-Kit learn to train a dataset on breast cancer data, and helps us predict whether a new entered data of a patient, gives the tumor to be malignant or benign

We use the data set on Breast Cancer from University of Wisconsin Hospitals to train our dataset. The dataset is being trained using scikit-learn by K-nearest neighbors classifier.
The id column has been dropped from the dataset as it has no contribution as a feature. All other columns except the class has been treated as a feature. The class column has been treated as a label, since we will determine, whether the entered data of a tumor tells us its malignant or beningn.

The classifier after being trained by the X_train set and then tested with the X_test set, gives a particular accuracy on which the program works upon.
Thank you!
